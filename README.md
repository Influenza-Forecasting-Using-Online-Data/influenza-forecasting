### Created a master branch where:
1. added the baseline plot notebook in the root (maybe is best if we put them here dunno).
2. created a "data" python module with "get_datetime_dataframe" function to get the dataframe that alex created (to get everyone up to speed)
3. created a "model" python model where i think we should put all model-related functions that we'll use (so far i just added the create_baseline function which creates the shifted baselines using the dataframe mentioned in previous point)
